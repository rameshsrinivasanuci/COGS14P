    "## Loops are a fundamental construct of execution control. Loops are a way of controlling repetition of code, i.e., allow the same piece of code to run multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Two repetion structures in Python are `for` loops and `while` loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "## `for` loops run a set number of times.  In a typical application, a block of code needs to be applied to the elements of a list or an array or list one at a time.    The number of repetitions of the code is determined in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## `while` loops run as long as a specific logical condition is true. The key difference between `while` and `for` loops is that *the number of repetitions in a while loop is unknown* \n",

    "Loops are a fundamental construct of execution control. Loops are a way of controlling repetition of code, \n",

    "`for` loops run a set number of times.  In a typical application, a block of code needs to be applied to the elements of a list or an array or list one at a time.    The number of repetitions of the code is determined in advance. \n",
